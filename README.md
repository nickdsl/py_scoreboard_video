# py_scoreboard_video
Script that helps to add a scoreboard to your volleyball video.

How it works:
1) you make a video in your video editor (cut all useless scenes)
2) you set up a OBS Studio and start record (black screen with scoreboard)
3) you started this script and answer the questions (Team names, first pitch, how many sets, etc..)
4) you press play in your video editor
5) all you need to to: watch the video and answer the question: who scored at this time
6) when match finished you need to stop OBS recording, drag that recording into video editor, put it above your main footages, use chromakey effect to remove black screen, render final result =) )

Enjoy =)
